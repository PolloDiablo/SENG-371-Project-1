Friday March 13:
  - Brayden: subreddit monitoring tool which will detect spikes in activity and notify developers
  - Jeremy: automated keyword graph creation using JFree Chart library


Tuesday March 17:
  - Brayden: TODO
  - Jeremy: investigate other visualization types which can be obtained from existing data
    - Compare bug mention activity between keywords of the same category (e.g. characters, maps, or items). 
    This list could be complete (e.g. all the maps), or a subset of the keywords in the category (e.g. a few of the maps).
      - Looking at patch notes and forum posts separately => wordcloud, piechart, or barchart
      - Comparing patch notes and forum posts => stacked bar graph
    - Could normalize the above data, to get the proportion of activity for each keyword
      - Difference between patch notes and forum posts => column chart (which items get the most/least relative attention)
      - e.g. http://www2.le.ac.uk/offices/ld/images/study-guide-images/numeracy/bar2.gif
    - Note: Must consider what time-span to look at. Shouldn't look at keywords before they exist in the game.
    (Their proportion would be relatively low).
    
Friday March 20:
  - Brayden: TODO
  - Jeremy: automate creation of alternative graph types
    - User could enter a list of terms (this is would be time-consuming, any better way to do this?)
 
Tuesday March 24:
  - Brayden: TODO
  - Jeremy: create tool for graph creation
    - Tool could automatically detect # of terms
      - If only 1 search term, do a graph of that term over time
      - If multiple search terms, autogenerate some of the alternative graphs
