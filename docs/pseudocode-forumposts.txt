Forum/Reddit Post Data Mining:

Reddit:
  Query variables:
    - SUBREDDIT (name)
    - STARTTIME (seconds since epoch)
    - ENDTIME (seconds since epoch)
    - KEYWORDS (a||b||c) - currently "bug||issue||crash"
  http://www.reddit.com/r/<SUBREDDIT>/search?q=(and+timestamp:<STIME>..<ENDTIME>+title:'<KEYWORDS>')&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&syntax=cloudsearch&limit=100
  e.g.
  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/search?q=(and+timestamp:1421698435..1421784835+title:'bug||issue')&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&syntax=cloudsearch&limit=100


  Specify "search.json" instead of just "search" to get results returned as a json object.
  Details: http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search

  ALGORITHM:
  Given: subreddit, startDate, endDate
  for (startDate < time < endDate) - with weekly increments
    Perform query to get all relevant posts this week
    for each post this week (above minimum threshold score):
      - get url (permalink)
      - get date
      - get title
      - get numberOfComments
      - get popularity (score)
      - get body of comments (selftext)
    All of the above data can be acquired from the search result json :D

 Limitations:
    - Can only grab 100 results at a time, the current algorithm will only get the top 100 posts each week
      - This may have an effect on the validity of the final results. A well-known issue may generate many more than 100 posts in the forum...
    - The data is still variable. People can vote and comment on reddit posts for months after they are created
      - However, post activity usually dies-out after a few days
      - So, posts should not be analyzed that are more recent than ~1 week (TODO)
    - Text analysis for keywords does not take into account word *meaning* i.e. sarcasm, jokes, etc.
=====================================
INTERFACE:
- The only thing that changes between games is the subreddit we are looking in, so there really isn't much here

public interface IRedditPostParser {
	/** Returns name of this game, will be associated with each database row entry*/
	public abstract String getGameName();
	
	/** Returns name of the subreddit*/
	public abstract String getSubredditName();
}
