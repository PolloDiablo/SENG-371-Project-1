Forum/Reddit Post Data Mining:

Reddit:
  Query variables:
    - SUBREDDIT (name)
    - STARTTIME (seconds since epoch)
    - ENDTIME (seconds since epoch)
    - KEYWORDS (a||b||c) - constant probably
  http://www.reddit.com/r/<SUBREDDIT>/search?q=(and+timestamp:<STIME>..<ENDTIME>+title:'<KEYWORDS>')&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&syntax=cloudsearch&limit=100
  e.g.
  http://www.reddit.com/r/leagueoflegends/search?q=(and+timestamp:1421698435..1421784835+title:'bug||issue')&sort=top&restrict_sr=on&syntax=cloudsearch&limit=100


  ****OR specify search.json
  ****Can just GET this with a request, maybe don't need to use Selenium...
  Details: http://www.reddit.com/dev/api#GET_search

  ALGORITHM:
  Given: subreddit, startDate, endDate
  for (startDate < time < endDate) - incremented each day
    - get url (to comments)
    - get date
    - get title
    - get numberOfComments
    - get popularity
    goto url
    - get body of comments

 Limitations:
    - Can only grab 100 results at a time, the current algorithm will only get the top 100 posts each day
      - This may have an effect on the validity of the final results. A common bug may generate many more than 100 posts...
    - The data is still variable. People can vote and comment on reddit posts for months after they are created
      - However, post activity usually dies-out after a few days
      - So, posts should not be analyzed that are more recent than ~1 week (TODO)
    - It may be beneficial to ignore posts which have a net score <= 0. Since they may be spam/unhelpful/inaccurate
    - Text analysis for keywords does not take into account word *meaning* i.e. sarcasm, jokes, etc.
