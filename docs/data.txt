Data is stored in a local SQLEXPRESS database.
The database consists of two tables:


1. RedditPosts:
- gameName - nvarchar(50) (which game this post is associated with)
- url - nvarchar(400) (guarenteed to be unique, this will be the table key)
- dateTime - datetime2(7)
- title - nvarchar(300)
- numberOfComments - int
- popularity - int
- body - nvarchar(MAX)

Which posts should be analzed for data?
- Storing data for all posts would be expensive (in time) and would yield a lot of data that will be thrown out anyway
- Only store posts which contain keywords: "bug", "issue", "crash"
- Only store posts with popularity >= 1

=====================================
2. PatchNotes:

- url - nvarchar(400) (guarenteed to be unique, this will be the table key)
- dateTime - datetime
- title - nvarchar(300)
- body - nvarchar(MAX)
