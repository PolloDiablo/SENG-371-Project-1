Reddit posts can be parsed for the following information:
- date (date and time)
- title (max: 300 char)
- body (max: 10000 char)
- numberOfComments (unsigned integer)
- popularity (signed integer)
- url (max: ~400 char) - guarenteed to be unique, so this will be the database key

- A separate data table will be created for each game

Which posts should be analzed for data?
- Analyzing all posts would be expensive (in time) and would yield a lot of data that will be thrown out anyway
- Instead, only analyze posts which contain keywords: "bug", "issue", "balance", etc.


Patch notes can be parsed for the following information:
- date (date and time)
- patch number (char/number mix), not available for TF2
- body
- url - will likely be the key, since date may not be unique, and patch number is not reliable between projects

- A separate data table will be created for each game
